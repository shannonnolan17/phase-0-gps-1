**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
I didn't have much confidence with the workflow and second guessed a lot of my work. Also working with Shannon helped me figure out new concepts like "fetch" and "merge." Moreover, our guide, Bison, helped explain the tab function that is very helpful with Git!

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
The overall workflow was really clarified. Although verbally we've beaten it with a stick, explaining it over and over, it's so important for me to develop the muscle memory and CONFIDENCE to literally click through it. I also learned to access the terminal history. Prior to this I also wasn't sure how to open a file strictly in sublime but now I know that command is subl <file name>. Moreover, moving the image from the desktop to the phase-0-gps-1 file was clarified as I had no idea how to achieve that before this!

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
I asked my guide how to move a file from the desktop to the active directory. I learned that ~/ is the Linux standard for your home directory. I also asked how to access the terminal history. Also I learned the ability of the Q command. 

**What still confuses you about Git?**
I wish I could see more visually what happens with branching, committing, etc. I can verbalize it and understand the workflow, but like how you can watch the GUI when adding files etc. and tangibly seeing exactly what's happening each step of the way, I wish I could do the same with the Git Workflow just to help me more tangibly understand what's happening. Sometimes I also forget that when you clone something, you don't need to use the command "git init" because it will already have the .git file in it as a cloned repo. I am also still confused on locally merging branches and the command for that. 

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
My first experience pairing was really good! Although I can be outgoing, I'm incredibly introverted when it comes to projects, work, etc, so I'm still working on finding a middle ground. The feedback will be very helpful for me - there's always room to improve! I will definitely work to get better with each pair!
