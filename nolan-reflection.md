What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was struggling with fetch and branch and merging it.
I was not totally sure when to use fetch and when to use pull and
which one is better. I also struggled with remembering proper
workflow and remembering to check myself and to add and commit
often!

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
I now understand what fetching is and how to properly merge on both
GitHub and locally. I also have a stronger understanding of
workflow and why it is so important. I also learned the difference
between git fetch and git pull and when to use them.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked about merging and how the proper syntax for it. I also asked to
clarify a couple of directions.

What still confuses you about Git?
I still have trouble with pushing properly and to the right location
whether its locally or remotely. I confuse the two quite a bit.
I am also still confusing on deleting things and making sure
not to delete important things.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was great! My pair was awesome and the guide was very
helpful!! We had a very nice and open environment. I felt
very comfortable asking questions and giving feedback.
